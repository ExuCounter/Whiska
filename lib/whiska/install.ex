defmodule Whiska.Install do
  @moduledoc """
  Writing Whiska's hook into a repo's own `.claude/settings.json`.

  ADR-0016 makes hooks per-project rather than global, and the file is checked
  into git so the rules travel with the repo: anyone who clones it and has Whiska
  installed gets the same enforcement automatically. Global hooks would mean zero
  setup per project but would not travel, which is the wrong trade for rules that
  exist to contain what a worker can do.

  ## Nothing machine-specific reaches settings.json

  "The rules travel with the repo" is only true if what gets committed works on
  somebody else's machine. An earlier version wrote two absolute paths into the
  hook command — the Erlang runtime and the binary, both resolved at install
  time — which pinned the file to one home directory and one Erlang version, and
  leaked a username into a shared repo besides. It also broke as soon as the
  runtime was upgraded.

  So the committed command names only a **shim** checked in beside it, and every
  machine-specific lookup moved into that shim, where it happens at run time.
  `WHISKA_BIN` and `WHISKA_ESCRIPT` override the lookups without editing it.

  The shim costs one extra process — about 5 ms. That was rejected when this was
  written, on the grounds that a shell wrapper costs more than ADR-0033's
  eventual native hook will cost in total. True, but the hook that exists today
  is an Elixir escript measured at ~124 ms per call, so the wrapper is about 4%
  of it. The cost lands on the version of the hook that can afford it, and the
  indirection means `settings.json` never has to change again when ADR-0033's
  native binary replaces what the shim points at.

  Everything here is a pure value except the actual write, so the merge behaviour
  — idempotency, leaving other people's hooks alone — is testable without
  touching a filesystem.

  # Every tool that a rule can actually deny, and no others.
  #
  # `Bash` earns its place: sniff mode denies mutating commands (ADR-0018) and
  # containment denies ones reaching into the main checkout (ADR-0013), so a
  # matcher without it would leave both rules silently never firing.
  #
  # `Read`, `Grep` and `Glob` are deliberately absent. They are a large share of
  # all tool calls and can never be denied, and ADR-0033 is blunt about it: not
  # running at all beats running fast.
